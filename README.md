# JavaProject
This is a Java program I built for my programming module in my masters degree at the University of York (for which I got a score of 95%).

It is a coin sorting app where a user can enter change into the program to certian coins back (e.g. if they were to enter £2.35 they would get a £2 coin, three 10p coins and a 5p coin) it is also possible for the user to exclude certian coins from the change they get back, users can also set the system currency and the minimum/maximum change value that can be deposited into the system too. 

It also includes a GUI version of the system rendered in JavaFX as well.
