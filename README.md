# JavaProject
This is a Java program I built for my programming module in my masters degree at the University of York (for which I got a score of 95% for this project).

It is a coin sorting app where a user can enter change into the program to certian coins back (e.g. if they were to enter £2.35 they would get x1 £2 coin, x3 10p coins and x1 5p coin) it is also possible for the user to exclude certian coins from the change they get back and to also set the system currency and minimum/maximum coin values to deposit into the system. 

It also includes a GUI version of the system rendered in JavaFX too.
